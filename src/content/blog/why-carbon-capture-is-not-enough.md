The world is racing against the clock to mitigate climate change, with carbon capture and storage (CCS) being touted as a key solution. While CCS technology has shown promise, it's not enough to address
the scale of emissions we face today. In this article, we'll explore why systemic change is needed in industry and policy to truly combat climate change.

**The Limitations of Carbon Capture**

Carbon capture is a process that captures CO2 emissions from industrial sources like power plants and cement factories. However, it has several limitations:

*   **Scalability**: While CCS can reduce emissions, it's not possible to deploy it on the scale needed to meet our climate goals.
*   **Cost**: Implementing CCS is expensive, making it challenging for industries to adopt this technology without significant investment.
*   **Energy Intensity**: The process of capturing and storing CO2 requires energy itself, which can offset some of the emissions reductions achieved.

**The Need for Systemic Change**

Systemic change involves transforming entire systems, not just individual components. In the context of climate change, this means:

1.  **Transitioning to renewable energy**: Shifting from fossil fuels to clean energy sources like solar and wind power.
2.  **Electrification of industries**: Transitioning industrial processes from fossil fuels to electricity.
3.  **Circular economy practices**: Adopting circular business models that promote recycling, upcycling, and reducing waste.

**Industry-led Solutions**

Some industries are leading the charge towards systemic change:

1.  **Companies like IKEA and H&M have implemented circular economy strategies**, prioritizing sustainability in their supply chains.
2.  **Transportation companies like Siemens and Bombardier are investing in electric vehicles**, promoting a low-carbon transportation future.
3.  **Energy providers like Enel and Engie are transitioning to renewable energy sources**, powering homes and businesses with clean power.

**Policy-led Solutions**

Governments also play a crucial role in driving systemic change:

1.  **Renewable portfolio standards (RPS)**: Policies that require utilities to generate a certain percentage of their electricity from renewables.
2.  **Carbon pricing mechanisms**: Policies like carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems that incentivize companies to reduce emissions.
3.  **Clean energy targets**: Policies that set ambitious targets for clean energy adoption, driving innovation and investment.

**Conclusion**

While carbon capture is an important technology, it's not enough to address the scale of climate change we face today. Systemic change in industry and policy is necessary to truly combat climate change.
By transitioning to renewable energy, electrifying industries, and adopting circular economy practices, we can create a more sustainable future.
